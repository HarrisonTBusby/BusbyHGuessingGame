# BusbyHGuessingGame



This program creates a random number and the user is supposed to guess the number. Once the user guesses the number, the console spits out the number and the number of guesses it took to get the number.

This program uses a switch statement, 3 cases, while loops, if statements, data validation, and the ability to play again. 

Revieweb by Isaiah Ferguson - Code worked as intended I tried to break it was unyeilding. the design is nice i like the switch statements and the loops work nicely. Good job!
